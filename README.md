# laravel-jwt-authentication 
 WT (JSON Web Token) authentication in Laravel is used to securely verify user identities during API requests. It works by issuing a token to the user after successful login, which they include in the authorization header of future requests. The server verifies this token to authenticate the user without needing to check the database on every request.
